At the same time, we got career coaches from colleges and universities starting to attend our events and follow us online. And they started asking for help, and they started asking me to come and speak. And they kept asking me to come back and speak, and my speaking career took off. That was a happy accident. I never, ever planned on becoming a professional speaker, but it ended up being something that I love and wonderful exposure for our business and our online platform. Furthermore, where colleges and universities were concerned, more and more college career coaches started reaching out to us and, again, inviting me to speak, and when I told them about our online course, they were extremely interested because their students were having trouble understanding what we were talking about. So I think that's one of the reasons why we're having trouble getting jobs. What they were teaching them wasn't working\u2014not in the new world of work.",

We couldn't figure out why were people driving all over town to hear me speak or listening to my free content online, but they wouldn't pay a really reasonable fee to get the entire course, all of our online content. We just couldn't figure it out. And then it finally occurred to us. Job seekers actually don't know how badly they need the help. They really have no idea. So we're trying to figure out what's going on with them, and we're trying to figure out how they can get that help, and we're trying to figure out how complicated a job search can be, and they have no idea where they're making mistakes. And so they just don't know how badly they need the help until they're in a crisis and they've been unemployed for too long, or they've been...you know maybe they're not unemployed but their job hunting and are just discouraged. So by the point they realize that they really need help, it's like a little bit of shame there too. You know people will spend money on golf lessons and tennis lessons, but there's some people who are just not interested in golf. And so you have to be able to get them involved in the process of getting them involved. And so that has been a challenge for us to figure out how to help people understand, you know, you really do need some help here, and it's an investment worth making. You know, you're really worth it. This is your career. You're going to spend eight, nine, ten hours of your day with people that you work with. You should love what you do for a living. You should be happy and successful, but you can't figure it out on your own, and you shouldn't try to.

        "message": "Okay, so Eric is very smart. He's a really talented financial analyst. He was early 20s working at a bank, absolutely miserable, working in a cube, pushing numbers through a system all day every day. He wasn't motivated. He was making good money, but he was really unhappy. And he came to us for help. Initially, he just wanted a new job, but we started asking questions like we always do. Is that all you want is just a job, or do you want to love what you do for a living? And he looked at us and said, well, yeah. I mean I want a job, and I want to love what I do for a living. Great. Then let's stop the job hunt for a moment. Let's take it step back and figure out why do you hate this job you're in so much, and what do you think would be fun for you to do for a living? And so we kicked back and looked at the, you know, what are your greatest strengths and passions, and what would be fun for you, and what should you do? And he ended up, he got two tremendous job offers, making a bunch more money at other banks. But we cautioned him because he was still going to be stuck in a cube doing work that didn't motivate him. And we encouraged him to consider consulting. He was very good at that and I think it's something that you can learn from your experience with the job. And he was scared but he did it anyway. Eric ended up landing a job as a financial analyst consultant. He tried to get into the industry, but then he got fired and had no job offer for his entire career, which is why Eric has been working so hard on this project since the beginning of his career. He tripled his income and all of a sudden was traveling a lot for work and having that food blast. So that's a great example of the power of just taking a pause and stepping back to ask a handful of questions before you just go get yourself a job so that you're really, you know, one of the biggest mistakes that job seekers make is they start their job search by hitting the Internet and applying for things, and that's a huge mistake. Do you want to know an analogy that is really the perfect analogy for this? It's like if somebody wants to be a doctor, they can't do it. They can't do it. But if somebody wants to buy a new house and they just hop in their car and start driving all over the city looking for signs in people's front yards, that is a terrible way to find a house. Sure, eventually you'll find one, but it's going to take you months and months and months and you're going to waste a ton of time looking at houses that you don't want and houses that you can't afford. And unfortunately, that's how most people approach their job search. They hit the internet and just start throwing spaghetti up against the wall. At our BEZ we teach people to first ask the question, what kind of house do you want? What kind of neighborhood do you want to live in? What's your budget? All sorts of questions like that in a job search. The first thing we do is help people isolate their target so they don't waste a whole bunch of time and energy applying for jobs that they ultimately either don't want or aren't qualified for. That is the biggest gift that our content gives to our users and customers.",

You don't just want to hire somebody who's qualified and can do the work. You want to hire somebody who's going to love coming to work every day. And so really I learned as a recruiter, because you may or may not remember, I worked straight commissions, which means I didn't get paid until I got somebody hired. And most importantly, if they quit or got hired in the first three months, I had to pay my money back. So that taught me to be really, really thorough in the interviewing process to ask questions about people's motivations. You know, what kind of a boss really motivates them? What kind of work gets them jumping out of bed in the morning? You know, what's a really bad day? So I learned as a recruiter to ask terrific questions to uncover people's personal motivation and job satisfaction criteria. And the thing is, if a candidate was well prepared, those interviews were a lot of fun. But most candidates couldn't answer my questions. They hadn't taken the time to figure it out. And so those interviews became downright painful for me because I had to ask them what they thought about me and how I felt about myself and how I felt about myself. I'd ask questions like, you know, what does an ideal manager look like to you? And they'd look at me like a deer in a headlight. And so all of a sudden what should have been an enjoyable, easy conversation was painful. I had to drag things out of people kicking and screaming because they just hadn't thought about it and they weren't prepared. So it really was from the hiring side of the desk that gave me the perspective of what candidates needed to think about before they started applying for jobs and interviewing so that they could make sure that they find the right fit and so that companies could make sure they were hiring someone who would be happy and successful for the long term.",

And then when I've got a dream or a vision, he can usually bring that to life with technology pretty quickly.",

If you can figure out what that burning desire is or that one problem that you want to solve, that people need, it's really \u2013 first, you've got to find your fire. You've got to find your own motivation. If you want to start a company just because your mom or dad or a friend told you should, that is not the reason to start a company. You have to really want it because being an entrepreneur is not easy. It's not easy at all, and you've got to have the fire in the belly every single day. You've got to believe in what you want to build. There's got to be a need and a market for it. So, um, you know, you're not going to have all the answers. You're going to learn a lot of lessons along the way, and you're going to have to pivot. So another piece of advice is find the fire in the belly, take that first step, but be willing to give up your fear and ask for feedback. Listen to it and adapt and pivot. Don't throw everything away, but you've got to learn as you go and just stay focused. Wake up every day believing that you can do it because there's so much more out there than just a few minutes. Another thing I learned the hard way is, oh my gosh, I really thought I had to figure it all out on my own. I waited way too long as an entrepreneur to start building a network of other entrepreneurs who could support and inspire me, who I could brainstorm with, we could refer business back and forth, we could encourage each other, we could give each other tips and tricks. I waited too long on that. And so if you're going to be an entrepreneur, it can be a very lonely, hard way to make a living. Don't try and do it alone. Find people you can trust, find people you would like to work with and find them for yourself. And then the other thing is that there's always this fear of being left out of the group. And so if you're going to be an entrepreneur, it can be a very lonely, hard way to make a living. Don't try and do it alone.

The one other thing I want to talk about, we've talked about mindset and inner critic. Really the thing that's the one most important thing for job seekers, even employers, entrepreneurs, anybody who wants to get more money, freedom, and fun out of work, they have to be willing to face their fears, figure out what it is that you're afraid of, and then figure out how to offset that fear. Fear is not something to run away from. If you're scared of something, that's a sign that you're onto something good and you should pay attention to that and then figure out what are you afraid of? What are you really afraid of and why? All right, what's the worst that can happen? If that happens, what are you going to do about it? The sooner your willing to face your fears for anything in life, the sooner you'll be able to achieve your wildest dreams. You will fall down. You know what? If you're not falling down, you're not dreaming big enough and you're not trying enough. You're playing it safe. You can't play it safe and wind up doing what you love for a living and finding happiness and success. You've got to take risks and just know going into it that sometimes you're going to get it wrong and you're going to go fall flat on your face, and that's okay. That means that you're doing the right stuff. If you never scrape your knees, you're not having enough fun out there. You're not playing. You're not stretching your boundaries, and it's time to start, you know, go big or go home.",
