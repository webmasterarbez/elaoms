        "message": "Oh my gosh, I took a job at a global IT consulting firm and I was a recruiter and my job was to help us hire fantastic people to go work at companies and I was absolutely horrified to learn at how hard it was for individuals to get a job. They had absolutely no idea what was happening on the hiring side of the desk, and we hired about one in 20, which means I had to reject, I had to turn down 19 people. And to make things even worse, I couldn't tell them all the things they were doing wrong. I couldn't tell them that they had the skills, but they bombed the interview. And it was just, it was really heartbreaking for me, and I wanted to help everybody, and I couldn't. I couldn't because I didn't have time. I couldn't because I really wasn't allowed. You know, companies are afraid of lawsuits, and if I give feedback to every single candidate about why we didn't hire them, it was opening the company up to, you know, legal risk. And so there I sat at the tender age of 24, desperately trying to treat people who were well and give them an opportunity to find their dream job while taking care of my company. And I just wanted to help everybody, and I couldn't. And so starting Arbez really, you know, the other side of it is that, you know, people really weren't being treated well in that recruiting world. So we're going to be working with our team and our team is going to be working with our team on how we can get them to work in that consulting world. The company didn't get paid to help individuals. It got paid to help companies hire. And so, you know, all these people were out on their own floundering, bombing interviews, missing out on jobs that they would have probably been great at doing in the past and then getting a job in the future. So it was a very, very difficult time for them. And starting Arvez was an opportunity for me to finally tell everybody what is happening on the hiring side of the desk. And with just a little bit of knowledge they would have the power to go get their dream job, negotiate for top dollar and not get into the hiring process for something silly. And with Arvez, running our own company we had the power to do that. So I think it's really important that we have this kind of relationship between us and our clients because if you're not in a relationship where you can't work together, you can't be in a relationship where you can't work together. We could do both. We could help companies hire top talent and help people really find that career and that company and that job that was perfect for them and gave them an opportunity to harness all their talents, all their passions, and get paid really well for it without banging their head against a wall.",

Self-doubt is absolutely hands down. The biggest challenge with starting Arbez was overcoming the self-doubt that, you know, number one, am I good enough? Do I really know what I'm doing? Who am I to tell people how to get jobs? Even though I'd been in the business long enough that I knew I was really good at what I was doing, it was a little different when you go hit, you know, the Internet and start reaching out to strangers and telling them, hey, I'm awesome. So the biggest barrier challenge in the beginning was absolutely, you know, the inner critic. It is the bugaboo that haunts every single human being on the planet, and my first year or two or three years of my life I've been told that it's a big problem. And I was like, oh my gosh. I had to spend a lot of time listening to inspiring books and podcasts and talks to remind myself that, yes, I am good enough and I can do this.",

Unemployment was up over 10%. It was absolutely really, really, really staggering and the, you know, millions of people all over the world that were unemployed and two things happened that year. Number one, I started a weekly networking group to help people find jobs and that was really filling my gas tank and giving me, you know, more and more success stories. And then I started giving the insight into where people get stuck and where they need the help. And it was around about that same time that we sold our online career coaching platform to a career consulting firm. So, yeah, I think it's really important to have that kind of a network of people who are willing to help you out in your own way. And so not only did I have this weekly group that filled my gas tank and gave me a lot of insight into what was really helping people, but then we also sold our first license to a career consulting firm, and all of a sudden we had career counselors using our online platform to help people find new jobs.

And we heard from dozens of career counselors who hadn't been on the hiring side that they thought that question was designed to put candidates in the hot seat and that companies just wanted to, you know, kind of stump somebody and see what they how they handled discomfort in an interview situation and how they might handle discomfort on the job. And that's a little piece of it, but the biggest reason companies ask about your weaknesses, they want to know if you're self-aware. They want to hire people because nobody's perfect. And no matter how talented and experienced somebody is, there are going to be gaps. There are going to be things they don't know, things they don't understand when they step into a new company. And the weakness question, they just want to make sure they're hiring somebody who, when they run into a brick wall or they're up against a challenge that they don't know how to do it, that they're going to raise their hand and ask for help and do the work to figure out what they don't know and get educated. What they don't want is to hire somebody who's a bull in a china shop and who is too proud or too scared to speak up when they need help or when they don't know how to do something. And that's what we're doing here. We're not going to be able to get the people involved in this conversation, but we are going to be able to get them involved in this conversation. So the weakness question is the reason it's still so popular is that you're looking for a candidate who is self-aware and confident and brave enough to talk about their gaps so that you can work through them together on the job. That's really the beauty of that question, and unfortunately, a lot of candidates step in and they're not ready for it, and they don't understand what an employer is really looking for.

There's another negotiation, that's another thing that our best has a unique, we're not just recruiters, corporate recruiting is one thing, but we were working for global consulting and staffing firms that only get paid when they bring the right candidate who gets hired. So in other words, we worked straight commissions and only got paid when we got the hiring right. And furthermore, if we placed somebody into a company and they quit or got fired in the first three months, we had to pay our money back. And that environment teaches you recruiting on an entirely different level than when you're a corporate recruiter. And so there were things that we were able to teach, that we are able to teach career counselors and candidates that you just don't know at the same level. So I think it's important for us to be able to do this work in a way where we can get them to understand what they need and what they need from us. And negotiation is one of those things. And so, you know, we understand the psychology and the success strategies behind negotiating for what you're worth and how to make it a win-win for you and the company.

And we teach candidates that you certainly don't want to start with asking about money, but you don't want to wait until the offer comes through to talk about money because if your expectations are above what the company intends to pay and nobody talks about it until an offer is extended and you're off by 10 or 20 percent, all of a sudden the deal is going to blow up because you are insulted as a candidate that they low-balled you and the company at that stage of the game is saying, what? think you are. Every other candidate was happy in this ballpark. And so, you know, deals fall apart because nobody talked about money until the very end. Instead, if you start talking about money at a high level, earlier on, you know, maybe second interview time, then it becomes a negotiation. And the chance of you and the company meeting in the middle is so much better. And, you know, it needs to be a conversation. It's not a battle. And the other thing is, I think that's what we're all about here in this country is to have an understanding of who we are and how we're going to do things for our clients. And candidates don't want to waste their time and companies don't want to waste their time. I often say to people, I don't want to drive a car I can't afford. And it's really the same thing. So that was one thing that was really shocking to career counselors is that that advice of never talk about money until an offer comes through is not good advice.",

So A, my own personal struggles with the self-doubt keep me centered and keep me focused on giving people meaningful advice that is sensitive to the fact that their self-doubt might get in the way. And then the second piece of it is I'm a storyteller. I use stories, a lot of personal experiences, and I share stories of people that I've worked with over the years.

They had absolutely no idea what was happening on the hiring side of the desk, and we hired about one in 20, which means I had to reject, I had to turn down 19 people. And to make things even worse, I couldn't tell them all the things they were doing wrong. I couldn't tell them that they had the skills, but they bombed the interview. And it was just, it was really heartbreaking for me, and I wanted to help everybody, and I couldn't. I couldn't because I didn't have time. I couldn't because I really wasn't allowed. You know, companies are afraid of lawsuits, and if I give feedback to every single candidate about why we didn't hire them, it was opening the company up to, you know, legal risk. And so there I sat at the tender age of 24, desperately trying to treat people who were well and give them an opportunity to find their dream job while taking care of my company. And I just wanted to help everybody, and I couldn't. And so starting Arbez really, you know, the other side of it is that, you know, people really weren't being treated well in that recruiting world. So we're going to be working with our team and our team is going to be working with our team on how we can get them to work in that consulting world. The company didn't get paid to help individuals. It got paid to help companies hire. And so, you know, all these people were out on their own floundering, bombing interviews, missing out on jobs that they would have probably been great at doing in the past and then getting a job in the future. So it was a very, very difficult time for them. And starting Arvez was an opportunity for me to finally tell everybody what is happening on the hiring side of the desk. And with just a little bit of knowledge they would have the power to go get their dream job, negotiate for top dollar and not get into the hiring process for something silly. And with Arvez, running our own company we had the power to do that. So I think it's really important that we have this kind of relationship between us and our clients because if you're not in a relationship where you can't work together, you can't be in a relationship where you can't work together. We could do both. We could help companies hire top talent and help people really find that career and that company and that job that was perfect for them and gave them an opportunity to harness all their talents, all their passions, and get paid really well for it without banging their head against a wall.",
