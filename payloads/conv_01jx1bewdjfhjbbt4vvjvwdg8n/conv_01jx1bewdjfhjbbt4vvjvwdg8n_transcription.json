And we were really in a room and he spoke about 15 minutes and they needed teachers and we just signed on the line. And I went with two other teachers. We met in Colorado and found an apartment and there we were. I stayed there one year. And I met a lady there who had taught in Peru and I wanted to travel. And she told me about two different schools there, one in Lima and one was the Cerro de Pasco Corporation, which was mining. I wrote to both and I was interviewed by a John Fechetti from New York City in a hotel in downtown Denver. And he talked to me and said, would you like to go there? And he said, I wouldn't. He told me, I said, he said, I wouldn't go there for anything because he was a New Yorker. But I said, yes, I'd like to go. And he said, well, they have good. I was from Minnesota or Wisconsin, good people. So we went there and we had a great time with the kids and it was fun being in the community with them as well as having this wonderful family that's been around for so long. And then when they got back home from school, they were all very happy about it. And then when they got back home from school again, they were all very happy about it because they were so excited about their kids that day and how much of an impact that has been on them over the years is just incredible.",

They were Canadians, a little Peruvian boy, and Johnny Wilshire, his father was English and his mother was Peruvian. And I taught those six children first through eighth grade. And I cried the first month I was there because I was the only person and I didn't know what I was doing. And I had a first grader who couldn't read, who could say his alphabet, but didn't know what an A looked like or a B. And I had an eighth grader. Anyway, wonderful time. I adjusted and I wasn't going to go home because people said to me, oh, you're going there all by yourself. Aren't you afraid? And I'd say, no, I'm going. And there I was, 14,000 feet. And I had my own little house. And I was there for two years, came home in the summer, went home in the summer, came back to Winona in the summer. And there I was. And I loved it so much that when we got back from New York City on our way back from New York City on our way back from New York City on our way back from New York City on our way back from New York City on our way back from New York City on our way back from New York City on our way back from New York City on our way back from New York City on our way back from New York city and then we were able to go out and see some of those beautiful things that we had seen at Winona. And so it's been a great experience for me as well. And then one of my favorite things about this trip is that you can get to know people who are going through a lot of different things with you and they're all I'm to school and I've got pictures of all this.
