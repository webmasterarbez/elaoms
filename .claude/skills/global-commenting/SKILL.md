description: "Write self-documenting code with minimal, helpful comments that explain the 'why' rather than the 'what'. Use this skill when: (1) Adding comments to explain complex logic or algorithms, (2) Documenting public APIs, functions, or classes, (3) Reviewing whether comments are necessary or redundant, (4) Writing docstrings or JSDoc comments, (5) Removing outdated or misleading comments, (6) Deciding whether code needs comments or should be refactored for clarity, (7) Avoiding comments about temporary fixes or recent changes, (8) Making code self-explanatory through better naming and structure, (9) Adding TODO comments for future work, (10) Documenting non-obvious business logic or edge cases."
