# Backend API

## When to use this skill:

- When creating new API endpoints or routes in any web framework (FastAPI, Express, Django, Flask, Rails, etc.)
- When working on files in `/routes/`, `/api/`, `/endpoints/`, `/controllers/`, `/webhooks/`, or `/views/` directories
- When implementing HTTP method handlers (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- When adding query parameters for filtering, sorting, pagination, or search functionality
- When defining response schemas, status codes, or error responses
- When setting up API versioning (URL path or header-based)
- When configuring rate limiting or throttling
- When designing nested resource URLs (e.g., `/users/{id}/orders`)
- When reviewing or refactoring existing API code
- When working on `.py`, `.ts`, `.js`, `.rb` files that define routes or handlers
