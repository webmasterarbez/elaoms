# Backend Queries

## When to use this skill:

- When writing raw SQL queries or ORM query methods
- When working on repository, service, or data access layer files
- When implementing database CRUD operations
- When optimizing slow queries or fixing N+1 query problems
- When adding eager loading or joins to fetch related data efficiently
- When implementing query caching strategies
- When writing complex queries with JOINs, GROUP BY, or aggregations
- When setting up database transactions for related operations
- When preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities (always use parameterized queries)
- When adding query timeouts for performance protection
- When selecting specific columns instead of SELECT *
