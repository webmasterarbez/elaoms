# Global Error Handling

## When to use this skill:

- When adding try-catch blocks or exception handlers to code
- When creating custom error classes or exception types
- When handling async/Promise rejections in JavaScript or Python
- When returning error responses from API endpoints (4xx/5xx status codes)
- When logging errors with appropriate context and stack traces
- When implementing retry logic or circuit breakers for transient failures
- When deciding between throwing exceptions vs returning error objects
- When writing user-facing error messages (clear, non-technical, actionable)
- When handling validation errors differently from system errors
- When implementing global error boundaries in React or error middleware in Express/FastAPI
- When working on files that handle exceptions, error responses, or failure cases
