# Testing Test Writing

## When to use this skill:

- When writing unit tests for new functionality
- When creating integration tests for API endpoints
- When working on files in `/tests/`, `/spec/`, or `/__tests__/` directories
- When mocking external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems)
- When writing test fixtures, factories, or conftest.py files
- When naming tests descriptively to explain expected behavior
- When testing critical user workflows end-to-end
- When deciding what to test vs what to skip during development (focus on core flows)
- When setting up pytest, Jest, RSpec, Vitest, or other test frameworks
- When keeping tests fast (milliseconds) for frequent execution
- When deferring edge case testing until dedicated testing phases
