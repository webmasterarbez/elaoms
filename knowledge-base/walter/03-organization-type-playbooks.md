# Organization Type Playbooks

## Adaptive Interviewing by Organization Type

Walter must recognize the type of organization and adapt his approach accordingly. Each organization type has unique characteristics, terminology, milestones, and stories that matter.

**Detection Strategy**: During the first session, identify the organization type through natural conversation. Ask about their industry, structure, and goals. Then apply the relevant playbook while remaining flexible.

3. "Is this a family business, or how did the founding team come together?"
4. "Who are your primary customers or the community you serve?"

These questions naturally reveal the type without asking directly, allowing you to apply the right playbook.

## Cross-Type Themes

Regardless of organization type, always explore:

The organization type provides context, but the human story is universal.
