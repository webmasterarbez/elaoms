# Answer Review & Summary Guidelines

## Synthesizing and Validating Collected Stories

As Walter conducts interviews across multiple sessions, the system accumulates a wealth of stories, facts, and insights. This guide covers how to review, validate, synthesize, and summarize the collected material to build a coherent memoir.

## The Review Process

### During Each Session

#### Real-Time Synthesis
- Mentally track key themes emerging
- Note connections to previous sessions
- Identify stories that are complete vs. need more development
- Flag inconsistencies or gaps for follow-up

#### Session Recap
At the end of each session:
- Summarize 2-3 key stories or insights captured
- Acknowledge emotional moments
- Identify what needs follow-up
- Preview potential next session focus

### Between Sessions

#### Data Review
The system captures:
- Full transcript of conversations
- Extracted data (names, dates, milestones)
- Stories and their elements
- Themes and patterns identified

#### Preparation for Next Session
- Review previous session summaries
- Identify incomplete stories
- Note unanswered questions
- Plan chapter focus for continuation

## Story Quality Assessment

### Complete Story Checklist

A story is complete when it has:

- [ ] **Clear context**: When, where, what was happening
- [ ] **Specific details**: Names, places, sensory information
- [ ] **Emotional truth**: How it felt, not just what happened
- [ ] **Characters**: People involved as real individuals
- [ ] **Conflict**: What made it difficult or significant
- [ ] **Resolution**: What happened, how it ended
- [ ] **Meaning**: What it taught, why it matters
- [ ] **Connection**: How it fits the larger narrative

### Story Depth Levels

**Level 1 - Outline**:
"We faced a major challenge in 2015 and overcame it."

**Level 2 - Summary**:
"In 2015, we nearly ran out of money. We had to let go of half the team. We pitched 50 investors before finding one who believed in us."

**Level 3 - Narrative**:
Full story with context, dialogue, emotion, sensory details, and reflection.

**Goal**: Get every significant story to Level 3.

### Incomplete Story Indicators

Red flags that a story needs more work:
- Generalities without specifics
- Missing emotional content
- Unclear timeline
- Vague cast of characters
- No resolution or meaning articulated
- Feels summarized rather than lived

### Follow-Up Prompts for Incomplete Stories

- "Let's go back to [story]. I want to understand more about..."
- "You mentioned [event] briefly. Can we dig deeper?"
- "I'd love more detail on [specific moment]."
- "We touched on [topic] but didn't fully explore it."

---

## Validation Techniques

### Internal Consistency

Check that collected information is consistent:
- Timeline events in proper sequence
- People's roles consistent across mentions
- Facts don't contradict each other
- Emotional tone matches described events

### Gentle Verification

When things seem inconsistent:
- "Earlier you mentioned [X], but today it sounds like [Y]. Help me understand."
- "I want to make sure I have the timeline right. Was this before or after [event]?"
- "Let me play back what I think I heard to make sure I understood correctly."

### Memory Validation

Acknowledge that memory is imperfect:
- "Sometimes memories shift over time. That's natural and okay."
- "If you remember it differently now than you did last time, both versions matter."
- "The story you tell yourself is part of the memoir too."

---

## Theme Identification

### Emergent Themes

Track themes that appear across stories:

**Common Business Memoir Themes**:
- Perseverance through adversity
- The power of relationships
- Innovation and risk-taking
- Learning from failure
- Building and leading teams
- Work-life balance struggles
- The burden and privilege of leadership
- Creating something lasting

### Theme Articulation

Help founders name their themes:
- "I'm noticing [pattern] across your stories. What does that mean to you?"
- "It seems like [theme] keeps coming up. Is that intentional?"
- "If you had to summarize the lesson of your journey, what would it be?"

### Chapter Theme Mapping

Connect themes to memoir chapters:
- Which chapters carry which themes?
- How do themes evolve over time?
- What's the dominant theme of the whole memoir?

---

## Synthesizing Multiple Sessions

### Cross-Session Connections

Look for:
- Stories that span multiple sessions
- People who appear in different contexts
- Themes that deepen over time
- Timeline events that connect

### Building the Master Narrative

The memoir narrative arc:
1. **Setup**: Who was this person before founding?
2. **Catalyst**: What sparked the journey?
3. **Rising action**: Building, struggling, growing
4. **Crisis/Climax**: The biggest challenge
5. **Resolution**: Overcoming, learning, succeeding
6. **Conclusion**: Legacy and wisdom

### Gap Analysis

After multiple sessions, identify:
- Time periods not yet covered
- Key people not fully explored
- Important events only mentioned briefly
- Missing emotional content
- Chapters with thin content

- Extracts and categorizes data
- Tracks chapter coverage
- Maintains people database
- Builds timeline
- Identifies themes
- Captures quotes

Walter uses this data to:
- Reference previous sessions
- Identify gaps
- Build on established context
- Create continuity across sessions
- Prepare comprehensive summaries
