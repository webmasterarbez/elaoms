# Timeline & Milestone Documentation

## Building the Chronological Backbone

Every memoir needs a solid timeline - the chronological backbone that gives structure to the stories. This guide helps Walter systematically capture dates, milestones, and the sequence of events that comprise the organizational journey.

## Why Timeline Matters

- **Structure**: Provides framework for organizing stories
- **Context**: Places events in their proper moment
- **Causation**: Shows how one event led to another
- **Impact**: Measures progress and change over time
- **Verification**: Creates factual anchors for the narrative

## Timeline Capture Techniques

### Direct Questioning
- "When did this happen? What year, approximately?"
- "Can you put this on a timeline relative to [other event]?"
- "Was this before or after [milestone]?"

### Anchor Points
Use known events to triangulate timing:
- "Was this before or after 9/11?" (for US events)
- "What year was your first child born? Was this before or after?"
- "Was the iPhone out yet when this happened?"
- "What president was in office?"
- "Was this before or after the 2008 financial crisis?"

### Relative Timing
When exact dates are unclear:
- "About how long after founding did this happen?"
- "How much time passed between [event A] and [event B]?"
- "Was this early days, growth phase, or more recent?"

### Documentary Evidence
- "Do you have photos from that time?"
- "Were there any press articles that might have the date?"
- "Is there a document or contract that would show when?"

## Milestone Documentation Format

For each milestone captured:

```
Milestone: [Brief title]
Date: [As specific as possible: YYYY-MM-DD, or YYYY, or "early 2010s"]
Category: [Founding/Product/Business/Team/Funding/Recognition/Crisis/Personal]
Description: [What happened]
Context: [What was happening at the time]
Impact: [Why it mattered]
Related Stories: [Stories connected to this milestone]
Key People: [Who was involved]
Before: [What came before this]
After: [What came after this]
```

## Building the Master Timeline

### Phase 1: Skeleton
Capture the major milestones first:
1. When founded
2. Major inflection points (3-5 biggest moments)
3. Current state

### Phase 2: Major Events
Fill in significant events:
- Key hires and departures
- Product launches and pivots
- Funding events
- Crises and recoveries

### Phase 3: Connective Tissue
Add the transitions:
- How one event led to another
- Time between milestones
- What was happening during "quiet" periods

### Phase 4: Rich Detail
Layer in stories and context:
- Attach stories to specific time periods
- Note seasonal or cyclical patterns
- Capture the texture of different eras

---

## Era Definition

Help founders define distinct eras in their journey:

### Era Characteristics
- **Time span**: When did it start and end?
- **Theme**: What was the dominant focus?
- **Culture**: What was the feeling during this era?
- **Leadership**: Who was driving things?
- **Challenges**: What were you struggling with?
- **Achievements**: What were you accomplishing?

### Common Era Structure
1. **Pre-founding era**: What came before
2. **Founding era**: Early days, survival mode
3. **Growth era**: Scaling, building
4. **Maturity era**: Optimization, maintenance
5. **Transformation era**: Major changes, pivots
6. **Legacy era**: Succession, new leadership

### Era Transition Questions
- "When did things fundamentally change?"
- "What marked the end of one chapter and the start of another?"
- "If you had to divide your journey into distinct periods, where would you draw the lines?"

## Timeline Integration with Chapters

| Chapter | Timeline Focus |
|---------|---------------|
| The Spark | Pre-founding timeline, influences, preparation |
| The Leap | Day one, first weeks, first months |
| The Founding Team | Early hires, team formation period |
| The Struggle | Timeline of challenges, dark periods |
| The Breakthrough | Timing of success moments, turning points |
| The Growth | Scaling timeline, expansion events |
| The Crucible | Crisis timeline, response sequence |
| The Evolution | Pivot dates, transformation timeline |
| The People | When key people entered and exited |
| The Legacy | Recent timeline, future orientation |

## Handling Fuzzy Memory

When dates are uncertain:

### Approximation Techniques
- "Was this closer to the beginning or middle of that year?"
- "Which season was it - were the leaves changing?"
- "Was it around any holidays or events you remember?"

### Bracketing
- "It was definitely after [event A] but before [event B]"
- "It was within [X years] of founding"
- "It was during the [decade/era]"

### Validation Cues
- "What were you working on at that time?"
- "Where were your offices then?"
- "Who was on the team at that point?"

### Acceptable Uncertainty
It's okay to record:
- "Approximately 2015"
- "Early in year 3"
- "Between 2010 and 2012"
- "Around the time of the first office move"

---

## Visual Timeline Elements

Encourage founders to think visually:

### Highs and Lows
- "If I drew a graph of your journey, where were the peaks?"
- "What were the valleys - the low points?"
- "Where would you mark the turning points?"

### Speed of Time
- "When did time move slowly? When did it race by?"
- "What periods felt like survival versus thriving?"
- "When were you in reaction mode versus proactive mode?"

### Color Coding
- "If different eras had colors, what would they be?"
- "What felt like a dark period? What felt bright?"

---

## Connecting Timelines

### Personal and Business
- How did personal events affect business decisions?
- When did business demands conflict with personal life?
- What personal milestones coincided with business ones?

### Industry and Company
- How did industry changes affect your timeline?
- When were you ahead of or behind the market?
- What external events created opportunities or challenges?

### Multiple Founders
When interviewing multiple founders:
- Note timeline discrepancies (memory differs)
- Capture parallel personal timelines
- Identify shared vs. divergent memories

---

## Artifact Prompts

Help founders gather supporting materials:

### Documents
- "Do you have any early business plans or documents?"
- "Are there board materials or investor updates from key periods?"
- "Any contracts or agreements from important moments?"

### Photos
- "Do you have photos from the early days?"
- "Pictures of the first office, first team?"
- "Any images that capture key moments?"

### Press
- "Were there news articles at important milestones?"
- "Any press coverage we could use to verify dates?"
- "Industry publications that covered your journey?"

### Personal Archives
- "Do you have journals or notes from that time?"
- "Email threads that might show dates?"
- "Calendar entries or records?"

---

## System Integration

The system captures:
- All dates and milestones mentioned
- Relative timing of events
- Era definitions and themes
- Stories connected to specific time periods

This builds a comprehensive timeline across sessions that serves as the memoir's chronological structure.

- [ ] Cover founding to present
- [ ] Include major milestones in all categories
- [ ] Define distinct eras
- [ ] Connect events causally
- [ ] Attach stories to time periods
- [ ] Note key people at each stage
- [ ] Capture both highs and lows
- [ ] Be internally consistent
- [ ] Account for gaps and quiet periods
