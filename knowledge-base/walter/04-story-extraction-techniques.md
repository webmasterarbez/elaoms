# Story Extraction Techniques

## The Art of Drawing Out Stories

Great memoirs are built on great stories. Your job is to help founders transform vague memories into vivid, detailed narratives that will resonate with readers. This document provides techniques for extracting the full richness of their experiences.

## The Story Structure

Every great story has structure. Help founders naturally tell complete stories:

### The Complete Story Arc
1. **Context**: Where were you? When? What was happening?
2. **Challenge**: What problem or situation did you face?
3. **Conflict**: What made it difficult? What was at stake?
4. **Choice**: What decision did you make? Why?
5. **Action**: What did you do?
6. **Result**: What happened?
7. **Reflection**: What did it mean? What did you learn?

### Guiding Toward Completeness
When a story feels incomplete, gently guide them:
- Missing context: "Set the scene for me. What was happening in the business at that time?"
- Missing conflict: "What made this so difficult? What could have gone wrong?"
- Missing emotion: "How were you feeling in that moment?"
- Missing reflection: "Looking back, what do you make of that?"

## The Five Senses Technique

The most vivid stories engage the senses. Use these prompts:

### Visual
- "What did the office/factory/space look like?"
- "Describe the room where this happened."
- "What do you picture when you think of that moment?"

### Auditory
- "What sounds do you remember from that time?"
- "What was said, and how was it said?"
- "What was the tone of voice?"

### Physical/Tactile
- "What did it physically feel like to be there?"
- "Where in your body did you feel the stress/excitement?"
- "What were you doing with your hands?"

### Smell/Taste
- "What did that place smell like?"
- "Was there a coffee cup in your hand, a meal being shared?"
- "What sensory details take you back there?"

### Temporal
- "What time of day was it?"
- "What season? What was the weather?"
- "How long did this moment last?"

## The Zoom Technique

Move between wide-angle context and close-up detail:

### Zoom Out (Context)
- "What was happening in the industry at this time?"
- "Where was the company in its overall journey?"
- "What else was going on in your life?"

### Zoom In (Detail)
- "Take me to that exact moment. What happened first?"
- "What specific words did they use?"
- "Walk me through it minute by minute."

### Zoom Out Again (Meaning)
- "How does this fit into the larger story?"
- "What would be different today if this hadn't happened?"
- "How did this change your trajectory?"

## The Character Development Technique

Stories need characters. Help founders bring people to life:

### Introduction Questions
- "Tell me about [person]. What were they like?"
- "How would you describe them to someone who never met them?"
- "What's the first word that comes to mind when you think of them?"

### Depth Questions
- "What was their superpower - the thing they did better than anyone?"
- "What did they teach you, explicitly or implicitly?"
- "What's a moment that captures who they really were?"

### Relationship Questions
- "How did your relationship with them change over time?"
- "What did you disagree about? How did you work through it?"
- "What would they say about you if I asked them?"

---

## The Pivotal Moment Technique

Identify and excavate the moments that changed everything:

### Identification
- "When did you know things would never be the same?"
- "What moment divided the 'before' from the 'after'?"
- "If you could point to one decision that changed everything..."

### Excavation
- "Take me to that moment. Where were you?"
- "What was going through your mind?"
- "What did you know then? What did you not know?"
- "How close were you to making a different choice?"

### Aftermath
- "What happened immediately after?"
- "When did you realize the full impact of that moment?"
- "How often do you think about it now?"

---

## The Contrast Technique

Illuminate stories through comparison and contrast:

### Before and After
- "What was [thing] like before this happened? What about after?"
- "How were you different as a leader before versus after this experience?"
- "Describe the organization on either side of this moment."

### Expectation vs. Reality
- "What did you think would happen? What actually happened?"
- "What surprised you most about how this unfolded?"
- "What did you assume that turned out to be wrong?"

### Internal vs. External
- "What were you showing the world? What was really going on inside?"
- "What did people see? What didn't they see?"
- "What were you projecting versus what you were feeling?"

---

## The Dialogue Technique

Capture actual conversations that mattered:

### Prompting Dialogue
- "Do you remember what they actually said?"
- "What exact words did you use when you told them?"
- "Can you recreate that conversation for me?"

### When Memory is Fuzzy
- "Even if you don't remember exactly, what was the essence of what was said?"
- "What do you remember about the tone?"
- "What was left unsaid that everyone understood?"

### The Weight of Words
- "Were there words that stuck with you - that you still remember today?"
- "What's something someone said that changed how you thought?"
- "What did you say that you wish you could take back?"

---

## The Emotion Mining Technique

Access the emotional truth of experiences:

### Naming Emotions
- "What were you feeling in that moment?"
- "Was it more fear or excitement? Or both?"
- "What emotion surprised you most about your reaction?"

### Physical Manifestation
- "Where did you feel it in your body?"
- "Did you sleep that night? Eat that day?"
- "What did the stress or joy look like from the outside?"

### Processing Time
- "How long before you could talk about this?"
- "When did you first cry or celebrate about it?"
- "How has your emotional relationship with this story changed?"

### Creating Safety
- "Take your time with this."
- "We can come back to this if you need to."
- "Thank you for trusting me with this."

## The Pattern Recognition Technique

Help founders see themes and patterns in their own story:

### Connecting Stories
- "This reminds me of something you said earlier about [X]. Do you see a connection?"
- "You've mentioned [theme] several times. What does that mean to you?"
- "There seems to be a pattern here. What do you notice?"

### Self-Discovery Questions
- "Looking at all these experiences together, what do you see?"
- "What would your younger self think about how these situations connected?"
- "Is there a through-line in your story that you're noticing?"

### Theme Articulation
- "If you had to summarize what you've learned about [theme], what would you say?"
- "What's the chapter title for this part of your journey?"
- "How would you explain this pattern to someone else?"

---

## Handling Incomplete Memories

When memory is fuzzy or incomplete:

### Acknowledge the Gap
- "It's completely natural not to remember every detail."
- "What do you remember, even if it's fragments?"
- "Sometimes the emotional memory outlasts the factual one."

### Use Anchors
- "What else was happening in your life that year?"
- "Who else was there who might remember?"
- "Is there any documentation from that time?"

### Work with Impressions
- "Even if you don't remember the specifics, what's the impression that remains?"
- "What's the story you've told yourself about this over the years?"
- "What matters more - the exact details or the meaning of it?"

## Story Quality Checklist

A well-extracted story should have:

- [ ] Clear context (when, where, what was at stake)
- [ ] Specific details (names, places, sensory information)
- [ ] Emotional truth (how it felt, not just what happened)
- [ ] Character depth (people as real individuals)
- [ ] Conflict and tension (what made it difficult)
- [ ] Resolution and meaning (what came of it, what it taught)
- [ ] Connection to larger narrative (how it fits the memoir)

## Red Flags in Story Extraction

Watch for these signs that a story needs more work:

- **Too general**: "It was challenging" - needs specifics
- **Missing emotion**: Facts without feelings
- **Passive voice**: Things happening vs. protagonist acting
- **Summary not story**: "We eventually succeeded" - needs the journey
- **Stock phrases**: Clichés instead of authentic expression
- **Missing people**: Stories without characters

When you notice these, use the techniques above to deepen the story.

## The Story Database

As you extract stories, the system captures:
- Story title and chapter
- Time period covered
- Key people involved
- Themes and lessons
- Emotional tone
- Notable quotes

This builds the raw material for the final memoir across multiple sessions.
