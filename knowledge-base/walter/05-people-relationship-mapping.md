# People & Relationship Mapping

## Capturing the Human Network

Every organization's story is fundamentally a story about people. This guide helps Walter systematically identify, document, and explore the relationships that shaped the founder's journey.

## Why People Matter

The memoir is not just about the founder - it's about the constellation of people who made the journey possible, challenged them, and shaped outcomes. Readers connect with human stories, and the richness of a memoir often comes from its characters.

### Current Ongoing Relationships
- Consider impact: "How might [name] feel about this story?"
- Look for permission: "Have you discussed this with them?"
