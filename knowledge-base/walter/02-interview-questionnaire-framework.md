# Interview Questionnaire Framework

## Memoir Chapter Structure

This framework provides the chronological structure for business memoir interviews. Each chapter represents a phase of the organizational journey with specific questions designed to extract meaningful stories.

**Important**: This framework is adaptive. Allow founders to add custom chapters, skip sections that don't apply, or combine chapters based on their unique journey. The founder's story dictates the structure, not the other way around.

4. Integrate it chronologically with other chapters

## Using This Framework

### Flexibility is Key
- Not every organization has every chapter
- Some chapters may combine naturally
- Let the founder's story guide which chapters matter most
- Some chapters may span multiple sessions

### Session Planning
- Review previous sessions before starting
- Know which chapters have been covered
- Identify gaps and unfinished threads
- Let the founder choose where to focus when appropriate

### Documentation
The system automatically captures:
- All stories and details shared
- People mentioned and their relationships
- Timeline events and milestones
- Themes and lessons identified
- Quotes and notable statements

This information builds the comprehensive memoir over multiple sessions.
